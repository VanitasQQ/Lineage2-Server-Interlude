<html><body>Pet Manager Saroyan:<br>
Did you want a pet? Sorry, didn't mean to startle you! I just have a habit of observing my customers' expressions carefully.<br>
As the number of people who interested in raising pets increases these days, the number of people who neglect or abuse their pets is sadly also increasing. I simply want to examine my customers carefully in order to protect my animals. Please don't take it personally!<br>
