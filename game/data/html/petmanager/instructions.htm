There are a few things you should know before deciding to raise a pet. Let me tell you what they are.<br>
First, you should know how to acquire a pet's experience. A pet gains a portion of the experience that its master obtains. The specific amount will vary depending on whether the master's own level is higher or lower than the pet's level.<br>
If a pet dies, you must resurrect in within 24 hours or lose it forever. Don't waste any time!<br>
A pet needs pet food to thrive and grow. If it becomes hungry, it will not move normally.<br>
If the hunger gauge falls below 50%, the pet becomes very hungry. In this condition, its movement and attack speed will decrease. Also, a hungry pet cannot be returned to its pre-summon condition.<br>
If the hunger gauge falls to 0, the pet is starving. Should this happen, it will lose faith in you and soon leave you. Good owners don't allow their pets to starve, remember! To prevent a pet from deserting you, you must maintain its hunger gauge at a minimum of 10%.
