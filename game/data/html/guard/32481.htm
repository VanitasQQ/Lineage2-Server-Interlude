!Guard Seizi:

Built right on the Gulf of Innadril, Heine is divided into blocks.

Waterways run between the blocks, which are connected by bridges.

Here in the northwest block, you'll find stores and blacksmith shops; the guilds are in the northeast.

The central block contains the city square, as well as the temple and a warehouse.
