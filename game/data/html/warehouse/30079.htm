<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Barder:<br>
Hmmm... So you want to send cargo, eh? There are so many strangers in town these days! I don't remember ever being this busy! I'm just a Warehouse Freightman now, but in my day I was a mighty Warrior! Trust me, it's not worth it! I'll bet you never thought you'd hear a Dwarf say that!<br>
Well, where do you want to send your freight?<br>
