A level seven or higher clan may form an Order of Knights at a cost of 10,000 reputation points. As many as four Orders of Knights may be formed this way.<br>
One clan member must be appointed as a Knight Banneret for each Order formed. The Knight Banneret's social status will improve with the appointment.<br>
Once established with a Knight Banneret, up to ten eligble clan members may assume positions as knights in the Order.<br><br>
