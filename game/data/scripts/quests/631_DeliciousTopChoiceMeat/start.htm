Beast Herder Tunatun:<br><br>
The meat of wild beasts is renowned for its succulence! From the clean taste of Kookaburra to the gmay taste of cougar, and buffalo, with it's strong, musky taste...<BR><BR>
Unfortunately, there's no one left to raise and slaughter them... As they mature, they become ever more menacing and ferocious!<br><br>
None of us dare go near them!<br><br>
