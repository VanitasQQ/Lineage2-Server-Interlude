Ugrrr! That Smell?! What is it? It smells horrible! Agghh... Ah! I remember now. Last week, Miner Bolter ordered a Miner's Pick... Yes... I totally forgot about that...<br>
Wonderful! This is the <font color="LEVEL">Miner's Pick</font> Bolter ordered. Hurry up and take this to him. And take that smelly thing, too!
