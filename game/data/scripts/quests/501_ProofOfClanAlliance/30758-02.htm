You seem quick-witted enough. I will explain the test to you.<br>
It's very simple. I trust you have drawn lots before? Think of this as drawing boxes.<br>
First I will summon 16 boxes. Among them, four boxes are enchanted and shout when they are broken. You must find all the enchanted boxes and break them so that they will shout four times. It is possible to break all the boxes, but there is a time limit. If you cannot break the boxes within the given time, they will all disappear.<br>
Shall we start the game?<br>
