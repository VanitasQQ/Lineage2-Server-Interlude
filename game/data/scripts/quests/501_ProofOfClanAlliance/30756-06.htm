I can see that you have what it takes to be a great leader, but to earn the respect of your peers your clan must demonstrate its ability.<br>
How about this? There is a witch named Kalis who lives near the Ivory Tower. She administers a test that determines one's heroism. Those who have passed this test are widely regarded as true heroes. If your clan passes the test, there will be no doubt of your abilities. What do you think? Will you and your clan take the test?<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest 501_ProofOfClanAlliance 30756-08.htm">"We will not take the test."</a>
