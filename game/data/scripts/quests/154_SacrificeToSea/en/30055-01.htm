<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Rolfe:<br>
Oh, this yarn is of quite good quality. Looks like... ah, yes, this is real keltir fur. Right now, I'm managing this warehouse on guild business, but I'm originally a tailor. The richest traders of Giran were my customers... Ahem.<br>
Hmm? What? The girl doll for Rockswell? Oh, right! I almost forgot. Now that you brought me the yarn, I can make her some hair. Just a moment, here...<br>
There! It's finished. Now she has orange-colored hair, and doesn't have to be a bald dolly. By the way, did Rockswell have a granddaughter?
