<html><body>Lighthouse Keeper Rockswell:<br>
They say that virgins were sacrificed to the sea a long time ago, but waterfolk like me have changed our ways. Instead, we make a doll in the shape of a girl, place it in a boat, and send it out to sea. The doll is our sacrifice to the sea.<br>
We asked Warehouse Keeper Rolfe to make the doll because he is good with his hands, but we must also make the doll's hair. So we need some good quality yarn.<br>
Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">keltirs</font> on the island, collect their fur, and bring them to <font color="LEVEL">Cristel</font> in the village. You can meet her at the well in front of the village warehouse. If you give Cristel the keltir fur, she will make yarn for you. Take the yarn to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Rolfe,</font> so he can use it for the doll's hair. When the doll is finished, bring it to me. I will compensate you well for your work.
