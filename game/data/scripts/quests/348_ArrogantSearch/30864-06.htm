The Book of Saint, the Bough of Saint and the Blood of Saint! Finally, the three holy items have gathered in one place. You did well, truly. I will use these to find a way for you to stand up to the mad king. In the meantime, I must ask another favor from you. It isn't anything difficult... I am asking because I am a bit tired. Can you go to the store next door and get me <font color="LEVEL">one Healing Potion</font> and <font color="LEVEL">five Antidotes</font>? I will finish this by the time you come back. I'm sorry to ask, but please do this for me.
