So you know as well. Then again, you don't see a beauty like Roxxy every day. Would a woman like her... be able to accept my feelings? I think about confessing my love to her hundreds of times each day, but... I just don't have the courage to tell her. When I thought about what would happen if she were to reject me... well, let's just say it stops me cold. It's been a week since I wrote a <font color="LEVEL">confession letter,</font> but I can't bring it to her myself.<br>
Do you think I can ask you for a favor...? Would you... deliver my letter to Roxxy for me?<br>
