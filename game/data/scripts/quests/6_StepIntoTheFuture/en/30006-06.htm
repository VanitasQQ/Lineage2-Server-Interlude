Really? That's wonderful! Hee hee! Baulro and Sir Windawood are both such good people. I guess things could work... yes, I'm sure they could.<br>
The I'm going to give you a special Scroll of Escape, which can open the Door of Time and Space, which in turn leads to Giran. <font color="LEVEL">It can only be used once,</font> so you must pay close attention.<br>
It can be used just like any other Scroll of Escape. And, here, this is the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Traveler</font> that Sir Windawood prepared. After you go to Giran, if you want to return to this Talking Island, show this Mark to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Galladucci at the luxury store,</font> and he will help you. He's a bit of a peculiar person, so be patient even if he gets on your nerves.<br>
Then I wish you a fun and fulfilling trip.
