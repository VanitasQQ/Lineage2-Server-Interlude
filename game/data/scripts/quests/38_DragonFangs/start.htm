<html><body>Guard Luis:<br><br>
I've been looking for someone like you.<br><br>
I trust you've seen the havoc wrouht thourhout Gludio Territory. 
It was enough to have Ol Mahum Stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us. 
Now the lizardmen from the south!<br><br>
the <font color="LEVEL">highway of the southern shoreline</font>that leads to 
Giran has seen frequent attacks by <font color="LEVEL">Lank Lizardmen</font>. 
People are scared. Even the template prists traveling to Gludin were attacked! 
We Gludio guards are already stretched thin.<br><br>
Will you help us?<br><br>
<a action="bypass -h  Quest 38_DragonFangs 30386-02.htm">I'll help!</a>
