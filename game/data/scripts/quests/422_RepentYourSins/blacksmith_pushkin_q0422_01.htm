<html><body>Blacksmith Pushkin:<br>
Manacles of a Penitent...?<br>
Ah yes.<br>
A strange item, but I can make them.<br>
Funny thing, too... I've been getting a lot of orders for these lately.<br>
They must be getting popular...<br>
I've memorized the ingredients:<br>
I'll need some Steel, an Adamantite Nugget...<br>
some silver...<br>
Here, take this list. Verify that this is what you want to order. These are serious manacles and cannot be handled carelessly!
