I'm beginning to think that those damned *Turek war hounds* are worse that the Turek orcs themselves. Not long ago I was attacked by one and nearly lost my leg! Please go and hunt 10 of them down at the *Orc Barracks*.<br>
You don't need to bring those filthy animals' corpses back here, just cut off their tails to prove how many you've killed.
