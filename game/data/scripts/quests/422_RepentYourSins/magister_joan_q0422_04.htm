Ah, it's you again!<br>
I'm so dreadfully sorry about the confusion last time. Yes, about your pay...<br>
I apologize, I'm waiting for approval and a check from the home office... ... err, ummm...<br>
To tell you the truth, I hired you without the approval of the Grand Magisters of the Ivory Tower! You may be waiting a very, very, very long time for your compensation. Please forgive me!<br>
I am so ashamed of myself...<br>
I'm always getting into trouble.<br>
I'm also stubborn!<br>
And obsessive-compulsive!<br>
Is that a bad thing?<br>
... By the way, who in the world are you?
