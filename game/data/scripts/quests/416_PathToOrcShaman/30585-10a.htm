Hestui Totem Spirit, which is in charge of the secrets of the universe, is the greatest of all.  Keep deep in your heart the Language of Flame that flows into your mouth. This is a language which cannot be taught nor written down on parchment. It's the key to communication with all the souls in the world!<br>
You can communicate with them but you still can't command them. In order to really make their souls shake with fear, you must learn the <font color="LEVEL">names of 99 souls</font> or inherit the <font color="LEVEL">wisdom of 99 souls</font>. You must choose one or the other. Which will it be?<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 416_PathToOrcShaman 30585_2">"I'll learn the names of 99 souls."</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 416_PathToOrcShaman 30585_3">"I want to inherit the wisdom of the 99 souls."</a>
